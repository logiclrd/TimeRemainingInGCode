This is a script that takes G-code files produced by Cura and adds Prusa M73 commands to update time remaining over the course of the print.

To use this script, place both the .ps1 and the .cmd file in the same directory (can be its own directory), and then drag your G-code file onto the .cmd file.

It may also work to create a shortcut to the .cmd file, and then drag the G-code file onto the shortcut.
